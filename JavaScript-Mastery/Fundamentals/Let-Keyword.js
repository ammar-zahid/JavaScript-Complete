// dont use var for declaring variables

//(block scope vs function scope)


// if we use var keyword, we can declare variable of same name more than once, which is not a good thing. We can also change the value of that variable

// var name = "Captain";

// var name = "Artistic";
// console.log(name);
// name = "Pakistan";
// console.log(name);
